# java-maven-email-sender
This is for sending Gmail with simple text message and with attachment. Inside this I have used activation and javax-mail Maven jar file as an dependency.
1. For sending simple text message used sendEmail().
2. For sending mail with attachment used sendEmailWithAttachment().
